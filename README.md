# Tin Roof Audition Three

This is my response to a problem posed by a interviewer from Tin Roof Software. I was given 1 hour to work on the problem.

### This is the problem prompt ###

Using React, Angular, or a Javascript framework of your choice, created a frontend application that allows for displaying photo albums for multiple users using the data located at the /users, /photos, and /albums APIs located at http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
 
1. The application should display a list of users
2. Selecting a user should display a list of photo albums for that user
3. The list of albums should show a thumbnail of the album, which is just the first photo's thumbnail.
4. Clicking on an album should show the entire list of photos in the album, using each photo's thumbnail.
5. Clicking on a photo should show the full size photo with the photo's title as a caption.
6. The application should support asynchronous pagination of albums and photos. 
 
Spend at least an hour but no more than one and a half hours to complete as much of this as you can. When finished post on github and send us a link, or zip your code and send it via email. 

### What I did with my hour ###

I have never tried using angular before. So I spent a few hours learning as much as I could and then spent an hour on this to see how far I could get. I managed to pull a list of users and display them. At one point I had a list of albums working as well. But I don't have a good enough understanding of how angular routing works to limit that list to only the albums relevant to a particular user. This is disappointing, but considering I started learning angular 6 hours ago, I'm not that surprised that I can't get much done in an hour. Given more time, I would learn about angular routing and discover how to pass model ids in order to limit the data shown.
